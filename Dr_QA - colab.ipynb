And we had anticipated documentation again, that was in power noise, uh, realm of excellence. So he was going to be presenting that information. Yeah, I believe provide didn't have some, you know, some clarifications to make regarding the technical aspect of things. Uh, last name as we discussed, I believe after the call, we had a quick chat and he was telling me about the technical requirements of the from a functional perspective and I thought we didn't actually go into a functional perspective. Right? I mean, both not uh, you were with the functional requirements around, but we were talking about a black box and all at the end of the call, if I do remember it correctly, so that was there and then uh promoted. So we can clarify things during the next call or you know, get the technical idea of it. There were technical items that were shared, um especially both in the white papers and the the technical explainers. Um and I apologize if there was a miss, but the commitment that was clarified on the last call was that accurate Steam is going to take those requirements, decompose those and prepare presentation as to what the technical, how we would technically execute on those particular things. That's what was committed to on the call. So, our expectation leading up to this and this was confirmed by chris with executive management on the on the accurate side that that was the intention where we were heading. Is that not going to be the case or do we not know because uh paranoia is late. I understand that, but I cannot gun from 100% because I need a lawyer. But uh do you have anything to add that? I mean now we're going to go and then you know, in the documentation perspective or should be clarified the technical aspects before that chris, I'm going to ask you to step in here because there's a pretty big miss happening or about to happen if if we can't get in front of this right now because we did pass off all of the information for several weeks leading up to this and um you know, as the recording was visited, we were anticipating a presentation or at least a decomposition of the technical asks. Uh yeah, I I agree with you. Uh our apologies. Uh Jonathan and tim on this miss. Uh so if we are okay, I feel that the team has not had prepared for this. So we we should not be based on the time of Jonathan and tim, we need to come back to Jonathan and team once we have some proper documentation from the team. So there's no point. And uh we're meeting up Jonathan and team unless if there are any questions from a covid steam, otherwise there's no point in continuing. Yeah, our apologists uh Jonathan and tim that uh the team is not prepared even today. And hopefully this is the last time we are coming unprepared because I know there are several black boxes which they discussed with us internally and I'm not sure where we're headed. Uh someone else over speaking. Is it travel? Yes. Yeah. So uh last time we went through the documentation, so uh we didn't create a scope document on the Blockchain side, but we go through the documents and tried out the first two steps that mentioned on the documentation. One is the uh trying out uh trying out the that th E network. Uh So we uh try to do a set up on that uh for the private transition. And also we have even through the uh the uh that uh Transcending solving solutions like one through the submarine sense. Uh So we go through the get help set up. But when we go through these to salute the three solutions, uh We come up with the better approach is to go with the touchy network because it's run on the sparkle. That is uh easier. And ah uh comparing with the uh comparing with that uh submarine since it's still in the ah on there initial phase, it's not we cannot achieve on the ethereum network using the submarine. Since like if you are building our own network then uh that's uh suitable with their approach. But with the current deuterium network we cannot proceed these marines and approach. But the tie kinda drop where we we can send the transition to the Tiki network and then from there they will send to this park put uh so at that time this transition, this private transition will not receive on the men pull other than that they will directly take to this part of Poland can form the transition that we tried out. And uh we what what we uh the days like we created a transition on the Tiki network and uh verified the main pool or that transition is coming like within uh milliseconds that get conformed and uh added to the chain. So uh that approach I think ah good way forward. So rahul and cirrhosis, can you document this so that we can share it to the team? Because I know we are uh we want clear path uh again as an executive sponsor for this particular project from our side without documentation. I don't want us to uh face a situation with the client so if we can create a documentation and then share it to decline so that we can take forward the technical discussions in detail. We need to understand the methodology taken um and then decompose each step in the train. And if you have console outputs of the, you know, of these things running, we're gonna want to capture that um you know, at each stage of the console output if possible. Or you know, segment them similar to like when you audit a smart contract, right, you're able to see each section as it operates um and confirm each stage. So that's the kind of academic level documentation that uh we were lead was going to be provided as well as, you know, just some high level roofs of the process. Flows has broken down from the two documents that were submitted, you know? Uh uh So uh what we can do is like we can give an approach document, uh where uh what's uh in the uh the strategy background paper? The recommended three methods. So we uh went through the two methods. Uh we tried out that two methods in detail, uh like they have an open source library and we went to that court. So now what we can properties like we can give an approach document which will uh which we can which is a good approach or what's the disadvantage of that one so that we can note it out on the document and we can provide that. Uh I think uh in the current situation, I think that uh that documentation will cover that initial scoping part um before I before I kick this back to Jonathan and tim. Um what I what I want to um ask for is you may have to run your experiments again, but we need to document the other experiments and the results of them so that when we're talking to investors and when we're talking to customers and they have just enough information to be dangerous. And they say, well, what about this? And what about that? We will have the evidence to say based on what we did here here, all the steps we did hear our results. We tried option number one document, option number one here are the outputs right? Um, here's option number two, document, option number two. Here. The outputs. That's the level of academic research we're going to need. Um, both should any of this become uh, unique intellectual capital and to overcome objections when it comes time to either audits reviews or when we have advanced conversations with highly technical co investors, um, inside index or outside with um taking on money, those are going to be very powerful tools that we're gonna need. So while we appreciate your efforts without documentation, we don't, we don't have a body of evidence that's applicable or usable for how we position this and gain financing. So, um, those things are hard requirement. Unfortunately, they're kind of inescapable because this is something new and I think also we just need to bring into the mix gents as well um, in that we left it last week that our main emphasis was going to be on the bin and smart chain in terms of actually getting funding. Um and the tai chi network I know because it's linking into spark pool will be working well for the theory in but I don't I don't know the answer to this question as to whether if the tiki network can either be replicated for bananas and other chains or whatever it might be. But clearly um you know if finance chain have their delegate ear's which they say These are the 20 people that we have nominated. Um we've got a lot more control over that type of relationship. So if we're going for finance chain first obviously the tai chi network is going to have some applique ability but not necessarily\""
